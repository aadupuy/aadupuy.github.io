As part of Cosmicflows-4, we calibrated the Tully–Fisher relation using 600 spirals in 20 clusters. Combining optical and infrared data, we refined distance estimates and derived a preliminary Hubble constant of H_0 = 76.0 ± 1.1 (\mathrm{stat}) ± 2.3 (\mathrm{sys}) \text{km s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}.
