We modeled the three-dimensional gravitational velocity field within z ≈ 0.1 using Wiener filtering applied to the Cosmicflows-3 galaxy distances. The reconstruction reveals one major basin of attraction linked to the Shapley concentration, and two repulsive regions — the Dipole Repeller and another near the CMB Cold Spot — offering insights into large-scale cosmic flows and voids.
