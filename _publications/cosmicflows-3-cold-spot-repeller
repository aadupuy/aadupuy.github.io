title: "Cosmicflows-3: Cold Spot Repeller?"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/cosmicflows-3-cold-spot-repeller
excerpt: 'We modeled the three-dimensional gravitational velocity field within z ≈ 0.1 using Wiener filtering applied to the Cosmicflows-3 galaxy distances. The reconstruction reveals one major basin of attraction linked to the Shapley concentration, and two repulsive regions — the Dipole Repeller and another near the CMB Cold Spot — offering insights into large-scale cosmic flows and voids.'
