We measured distances for nearly 10,000 spiral galaxies using the Tully–Fisher relation calibrated across optical and infrared bands. A random forest model was developed to predict dust attenuation, leading to a Hubble constant estimate of \( H_0 = 75.1 ± 0.2 \text{km s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} \).
