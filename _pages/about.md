# Alexandra Dupuy

**Astrophysicist & Data Scientist**  
Using deep learning and data analysis to turn complex datasets into actionable insights.

---

I develop machine learning models to extract insights from large, noisy datasets. My research focuses on reconstructing 3D cosmological fields from sparse observations, combining scientific modeling with advanced deep learning. I’m passionate about applying these techniques to real-world data science problems.
