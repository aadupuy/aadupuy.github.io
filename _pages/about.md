I'm Alexandra Dupuy, an astrophysicist and data scientist. I develop deep learning models and various other data analysis techniques to extract insights from complex, large-scale datasets. My research focuses on reconstructing 3D cosmological fields from sparse and noisy observations, combining scientific modeling with advanced computational techniques. Beyond research, I am passionate about applying my skills to real-world data science problems, turning data into actionable insights, and building intuitive visualizations for complex systems.
