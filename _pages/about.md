I’m Alexandra Dupuy, an astrophysicist and data scientist based in Seoul, South Korea.

I develop deep learning models and advanced data analysis pipelines to extract insights from complex, large-scale datasets. My recent work focuses on 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to reconstruct spatial fields (dark matter density, gravitational potential and peculiar velocity fields) from sparse, noisy observational data (radial peculiar velocity data).

I’m passionate about applying these skills to real-world data science challenges—transforming data into actionable insights, optimizing decision-making, and visualizing complex systems intuitively.
